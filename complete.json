Big bump last year since getting the promotion to director. I could make even more by moving to the US HQ (up to 2xgross, 3xnet) but I prefer staying in Belgium. My US colleagues have a lot more money in their pocket, but have to spend it all on housing, health, education, entertainment, etc. I'm more content to live in a country that takes care of its citizens, even if it means paying high taxes. I have teenage kids of which one has health issues - I'm blessed to be able to deal with this in Belgium. Also, the higher education choices they'll make soon are not going to financially cripple me or them. I'm very fortunate to be in this position, don't mind sharing my wealth. I am locked in a golden cage now though - recently looked at a superinteresting director position at a local Belgian company and the monthly salary was 5K to 6K max. I'll stay where I am for now."
